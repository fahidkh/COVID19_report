process management using various system calls and file manipulation using another set of system calls exercise

Write a C program that uses the following pseudo-code:
• The main program creates two parallel processes, and each process reads one of the files
(the 2020 year and the 2021 year).
• Each process reads the corresponding file and creates the analysis summary (the key
findings) in an output file as follows:
o For each year, the total of cases over the year, the total of deaths over the year, the
maximum number of cases reported per date, and the maximum number of deaths
reported per date.
• The main program reads the output data generated by each process and generates the final
output in a file to report the following:
o Across the two years, the total of cases, the total of deaths, the maximum number
of cases reported per date, and the maximum number of deaths reported per date.
